SQL Murder Mystery
URL: https://mystery.knightlab.com/

SQL Murder Mystery Approach:
My data-driven approach to solving this task involved executing data integration operations such as utilizing table joins and filtering techniques to  
gain insights into the identity of the murderer. 

Task:
"A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. 
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database"


----Objectives:

1) Analyze Crime Scene Report based on murders that occurred on January 15 2018 and took place in SQL City

Approach:
select *
from crime_scene_report
where date = 20180115 and city like '%SQL City%'

Displayed Results:
20180115	murder	Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".



2) Querying the person table to identiy witnesses #1 living at the last house on Northwestern Dr. and witness #2 named Annabel.

First Witness Approach:
select * 
from person
where address_street_name like '%Northwestern Dr%'
order by address_number desc;

2nd Witness Approach::
select * 
from person
where name like '%Annabel%' and address_street_name like '%Franklin Ave%'

Displayed Results: 

Witness 1:
14887	Morty Schapiro	118009	4919	Northwestern Dr	111564949

Witness 2:
16371	Annabel Miller	490173	103	Franklin Ave	318771143

3) Examine the interview table and use the get_fit_now_member person_id to link with the inteview's person id

Witness 1 Approach:
select *
from person a
join interview b
on a.id = b.person_id
where a.name like '%Morty%'

Witness 2 Approach: 
select *
from get_fit_now_member a
join interview b
on a.person_id = b.person_id
where name like '%Annabel Miller%' 
            
Display Results:
Witness 1 (Morty Schapiro):
14887	Morty Schapiro	118009	4919	Northwestern Dr	111564949	14887	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

Witness 2 (Annabel Miller):
90081 16371	Annabel Miller	20160208	gold 16371	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.


4) locate the "get_fit_now" gym members who went to the gym on Jaunary 9 2018, has a gold status membership, membership id starts with 
"48Z".

Approach:
select *
from get_fit_now_member a
join get_fit_now_check_in b
on b.membership_id = a.id
where check_in_date = '20180109' and membership_id like '%48Z%' and membership_status like '%gold%'

Displayed Results:
48Z7A	28819	Joe Germuska	20160305	gold	48Z7A	20180109	1600	1730
48Z55	67318	Jeremy Bowers	20160101	gold	48Z55	20180109	1530	1700


5) Find the owner of the vehicle that the UNSUB got into

Approach:
select 
a.name,
a.license_id,
b.plate_number
from drivers_license b
join person a
on b.id = a.license_id
where B.plate_number like '%H42W%'

Displayed Results:
Tushar Chandra	664760	4H42WR
Jeremy Bowers	423327	0H42W2
Maxine Whitely	183779	H42W0X <----- starts with H42W

6) find information about maxine whitely, joe germuska, and jeremy bowers

Approach:
Maxine Whitely query:
SELECT *
FROM person a
JOIN interview b ON a.id = b.person_id
join drivers_license c on a.license_id = c.id
where a.name like '%Maxine Whitely%' 

Displayed Results:
No result (no interview was made)

Tushar Query:
SELECT *
FROM person a
JOIN interview b ON a.id = b.person_id
join drivers_license c on a.license_id = c.id
where a.name like '%Tushar%'

Displayed Results:
No results (No interview was conducted)

Jeremy Bowers query: <=== The Murderer
SELECT *
FROM person a
JOIN interview b ON a.id = b.person_id
join drivers_license c on a.license_id = c.id
where a.name like '%Jeremy Bowers%'

Displayed Results: 
67318	Jeremy Bowers	423327	530	Washington Pl, Apt 3A	871539279	67318	I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67").

Game Prompt:
Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.


7) Find the mastermind behind the murder.

Approach: 
SELECT *
FROM person a
JOIN drivers_license b ON a.license_id = b.id
join facebook_event_checkin c on a.id = c.person_id
join income d on a.ssn = d.ssn 
where b.gender like '%female%' and b.car_make like '%Tesla%' and b.hair_color like '%red%'
order by d.annual_income desc;

Displayed Result:
